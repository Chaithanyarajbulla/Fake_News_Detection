## üì∞ Project Overview

Fake news has become a major problem in today's digital age. This project leverages Machine Learning to detect fake news by analyzing the text content. The pipeline includes:

1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
3. Logistic Regression model training  
4. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)  
5. Word cloud visualizations for FAKE vs REAL news  
6. Predicting new news articles

## üìÇ Dataset

This project uses the **Fake and Real News Dataset** from Kaggle:

- [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)  

The dataset contains two CSV files:

- `Fake.csv` ‚Üí FAKE news articles  
- `True.csv` ‚Üí REAL news articles  

Each file contains columns: `title`, `text`, `subject`, `date`.

## ‚ú® Features

- **title + text** ‚Üí Combined as the main text feature  
- **label** ‚Üí FAKE (0) or REAL (1)  
- **text_length** ‚Üí Number of characters in each news article
